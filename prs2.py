# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.
a = 5
b = 5
print(a + b)

# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
a = 20
b = 2
print("Remainder when a is didvided by b is ", a % b )


# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.
a = input("Enter the value of a: ")
print(type(a))

# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80
a = int(input("Enter the number 1:"))
b = int(input("Enter the number 2:"))
print("a is greater then b is", a>b)

# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
a = int(input("Enter the number 1:"))
b = int(input("Enter the number 2:"))
print("The average of these two number is", (a+b)/2)


# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
a = int(input("Enter the number :"))
print("The square of the number is", a*a)
print("The square of the number is", a**2)
# print("The square of the number is", a^2) (incorrect for finding square of a number i python)
